# UC Berkeley Data Science W210 Portfolio

This repository showcases my work for the UC Berkeley Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program, specifically for the course Data Science W210: Capstone. The projects and analyses here demonstrate my ability to apply advanced data science, machine learning, and software engineering skills to real-world problems.

## Course Summary & Learning Objectives

**Data Science W210: Capstone** is the culminating experience of the MIDS program. The course emphasizes:
- Applying the full data science lifecycle to complex, open-ended problems.
- Integrating statistical analysis, machine learning, and domain knowledge.
- Building production-quality, reproducible, and well-documented solutions.
- Communicating results effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

**Project Description:** [UC Berkeley Enroute Capstone Project (2023)](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2023/enroute)

### What is enRoute?

enRoute is a mobile app designed to help runners—especially female runners—plan safer running routes. The app enables users to plot running routes on an interactive map, displaying visual information such as sidewalk availability (one side, both sides, or none) and, for nighttime runs, the locations of streetlights. Users can select whether they will be running during daylight or after dark, and the app adjusts the information shown accordingly.

enRoute calculates a safety score for each route, leveraging data on historical motor vehicle collisions with pedestrians at intersections and the locations of assault crimes. The pilot project focuses on the city of Toronto, using open data from the city’s Open Data Portal.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive route planning with safety-focused map overlays
- Sidewalk and streetlight visualization
- Day/night mode for context-aware safety information
- Data-driven safety scoring based on real-world incidents

- **Key Skills:** Data wrangling, visualization, geospatial analysis, hypothesis generation.

### 2. Clustering Model Development
- **File:** `victor_ramirez_enroute_clustering_model_tensorflow.ipynb`
- **Description:** Developed and evaluated a clustering model using TensorFlow to identify patterns in enroute traffic data.
- **Key Skills:** Machine learning (unsupervised learning), TensorFlow, model evaluation, reproducibility.

### 3. Data Engineering & Integration
- **Files:** `EDA/data/toronto/` (various shapefiles and datasets)
- **Description:** Integrated multiple data sources, including geospatial files and traffic records, to support downstream analysis and modeling.
- **Key Skills:** Data integration, geospatial data processing, ETL pipelines.

## Additional Highlights
